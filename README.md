# JS-Pub-Quiz

Finding questions for a javascript pub quiz turned out to be much harder than I originally anticipated.
Not all of them are great but there are quite a few amusing ones and I thought they might come in handy for the next pub quiz organiser.

Original event can be found - https://www.meetup.com/js-monthly/events/235933058/

I've included a pdf version of the presentation, the answer sheet and the team sheet

Feel free to update questions / add them - if there's interest I could move this into an editable file
